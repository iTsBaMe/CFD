The upwind scheme is designed to handle both positive and negative convection coefficients effectively. 
Its fundamental idea is to adjust the discretization direction based on the sign of the convection coefficient. 
When the convection coefficient is positive, the upwind scheme uses values from the upstream (or ‘upwind’) (i-1) direction
side of the computational domain for discretization, similar to the backward scheme. Conversely, 
when the convection coefficient is negative, it uses values from the downstream (or ‘downwind’) side(i+1), similar to the forward
scheme.

Backward difference scheme for discretization of the convection term is not effective for negative coefficients.
